How to download code onto brain (hi guill)

download vs code and install it 
https://code.visualstudio.com

add the VEX Robotics extension
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VEXRobotics.vexcode

download the repository from github
(you're already here)

unzip the file and leave it as a folder on your desktop

open the directory in vs code

click on the vex icon in the side bar of vs code (looks like a V in a box)

it should recognize it as a vex project

plug in the brain or controller

probably change the slot number to not mess up the code that already on there (unless ur really sure its good)

press download (its at the bottom of the vs code ui)

it should be on the brain now

if it dont worky you know how to contact me
